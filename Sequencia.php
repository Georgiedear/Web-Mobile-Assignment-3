            Sequencia (2014) is an interactive installation that requires the user's very presence
            to exist. By itslef, Sequencia consists of three blank white canvases aligned horizontally
            to one another. The first two frames have a couple of white origami figures of butterflies
            and birds. Once the user steps into the interactive space, the canvases quickly begin to 
            fill with colours from one canvas to the other in sequence through a projection. 
            Users can take what they want from Sequencia but once they step out of the space the
            canvases fade back to their blank spaces, only to be revived once again by its next 
            visitor.
