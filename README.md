# Web-Mobile-Assignment-3-Georgina-Yeboah
A responsive installation website featuring my three favourite interactive installation projects.

#Three Worlds Live Site
The latest version of Tree Worlds can be accessed here: http://ocad.ckprototype.com/public/Web-Mobile-Assignment-3-Georgina-Yeboah/


#Browser
Three Worlds works on Google Chrome but feel free to try other browsers.

# SOME NOTES
Due to loading issues sometimes the navbar may not be responsive right away. 
Just wait for the entire page to load or refresh.

The Isotope gallery on the 1000 Dreams Or More page may not show right away. 
A good refresh or resizing of the window should do the trick.
