<p class="dreamsText"> 1000 Dreams or more (2015) is an interactive installation that collected 
    and projected users' wishes in real time. The keywords in each wish entered
    would be categorized as either a spirtual wish (blue), a materialized wish (pink) or a wish concenring 
    someone else. Other wishes entered that did not match any of the three categories would be displayed as 
    a white translucent orb with tinted colours. Each wish entered was accompanied by a poem, 
    describing the nature of the user's wish, later to vanish, leaving the wish to float among the other wishes
    entered before it. 
    <br>
    1000 Dreams or More was inspired by my feelings of uncertanity and not knowing what lied ahead in my
    future endeavors. Creating this piece helped me find solace knowing that we all the know what lies
    ahead but we can all hope and dream.
